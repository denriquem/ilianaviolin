			</Text>
			<Text color="#4C2A85" fontWeight="bold" fontSize="xl" my={4}>
				Iliana Marinov began playing the violin and piano at age seven, and gave
				her first recital at the age of nine. She began learning both
				instruments through the Suzuki method in Cambridge, and went on to do
				her ABRSM Diploma in Violin Performance at the age of sixteen.
			</Text>
			<Text color="#4C2A85" fontWeight="bold" fontSize="xl" my={4}>
				She has also performed in a variety of musical ensembles over the years,
				and taken leadership roles in orchestras. She completed a masterâ€™s
				degree in literature before deciding to return to all things violin and
				piano. Iliana took on her first student as a teenager after taking
				Suzuki teacher training sessions.
			</Text>
			<Text color="#4C2A85" fontWeight="bold" fontSize="xl">
				Iliana now has a lively young practice, teaching violin and piano from
				her home in Chesterton, Cambridge. Iliana believes that every child has
				the potential to excel in a musical instrument.
